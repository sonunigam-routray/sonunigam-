     - Click on "border" of any shape
     - Drag and rotate the nodes

3. Free Transform: It is used to resize, rotate and stretch or skew [tilt] the object.

	        Flash Animations
	        ==============
Flash animations are categorized into 2 type
1. Frame by Frame Animation
2. Tweening Animation
	a) Motion
	b) Shape Tween


Frame By Frame Animation:
=======================

Press "F6" for a Key Frame - Duplicate 
Press Ctrl + Enter


	           Flash Animations
1. Frames
    - Animation is designed with frames.
    - Every frame specifies the position or shape of object.
    - Frames are several types
	a) Empty Frame   
	     without any object.
	b) Key Frame
	     with object having animation. 
                       insert by using "F6" function key
	c) Static Frame
	      with object but no animation.
	      insert by using "F5" function key
   - The default animation is 12 frames/sec
   - Best movie animation frame rate is 25 frames/sec
   - To change frames/sec
	[right click on stage - select Properties]

2. Layers
   - Every object must be in a separate layer
   - You can add or remove layers from time line.
   - Object can be sent back or forward by changing the layer position

Animation Types:
1. Frame - by - Frame Animation
2. Tweening Animations

Frame-by-Frame Animation:
=======================
- We have to design every frame individually.
- Object can change its position or shape in every frame.
- 25 frames with give 1 sec animation.
- If you have to continue object without animation then use "F5" static frame
- If you have to continue object with animation then use "F6" key frame.

Ex:
1. Create a new Project
2. Add 2 Layers and rename as
	+ Polygon
	+ Oval
3. Draw Polygon in polygon layer at Frame-1
4. Draw Oval in oval layer at Frame-1
5. Select Frame 60 for Polygon layer and Press F5
    [We want polygon to continue but without animation]
6. Goto oval layer Frame-2 and press "F6" function key.
7. In frame-2 change the position or shape of oval.
8. Repeat keyframes for oval until animation is completed upto 60 frames.
9.  Press "Enter" key to run once.
10. PRess "Ctrl +  Enter" keys to run continous.

Tweening Animation:
==================
 In tweening animation we have to design the nodes i.e end points. Flash will design all the frames between starting and end point automantically.
 
 You can add any number of end points in tween animation. The tweening animation is again classified into 2 types

	a) Motion Tween
	b) Shape Tween

Motion Tween: It allows to change the size, orientation and location of object. You can't change the object shape into another object.

Ex:
1. Create a new Project
2. Add layers
	a) Box 
	b) Text
3. Draw a box in box layer
4. Insert text in text layer
5. Select frame 10 for box and F5
6. Select frame 10 for text and press F6
7. In text layer select all frames from 1 to 10.
8. Right Click on selected frames and select
	"Create Motion Tween"
9. Select at 20, 30, 40 frames and change animation for text.
10. Box layer use F5 upto 40
11. Ctrl +Enter
